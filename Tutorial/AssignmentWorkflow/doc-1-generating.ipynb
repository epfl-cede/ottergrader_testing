    "* complete the assignment notebook with instructions, solutions and tests + don't forget configuration elements\n",
    "* IMPORTANT: execute the assignment notebook and save (the grader needs the outputs)\n",
    "* then in the command line run: `otter assign assignment.ipynb dist` => will generate distrib for students and grader in the \"dist\" folder\n",
    "* the notebook in folder dist/student is pruned to remove config elements, solutions and hidden tests\n",

    "Notes:\n",
    "* if the assignment requires additional files (e.g. figures or data), they need to be specified in the config options at the top of the assignment notebook  \n",
    "  /!\\ does NOT take folders, need to specify file by file...\n",
    "* if the assignment notebook is not alone in the folder, then you need to give the name of the notebook which contains the tests to the grader in the init cell otherwise students cannot run the public tests (can be generated automatically using the config \"init cell\" at the top of the assignment)  \n",
    "  /!\\ in that case, the students should NEVER rename the notebook!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have gathered students' submissions, you can grade them with the [grading notebook](doc-2-grading.ipynb) (otherwise needs containers)\n",

    "\n",
    "The grader executes also the public tests, which may not have points but may have messages.  \n",
    "We recommend:\n",
    "* that hidden tests should have messages (otherwise put boolean false)\n",
    "* that public tests have points too ???\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## TODO\n",
    "* we need to test the different options for designing the assignments \n",
    "* we need to write an **appropriate doc** for the syntax to create the assignments as the existing one is CRAP!\n",
    "* we need to figure out a way to do batch grading without containers\n",
