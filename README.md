This repository contains examples and documentations regarding the use of Otter Grader.

The "AssignmentWorkflow" folder illustrates all steps to create an assignement with Otter and generate automatically a notebook for students and a grader to evaluate students' submissions.   
This folder includes:
- an example assignment
- a notebook describing how to generate the student notebook and the grader
- a notebook describing how to grade students' submissions
- some sample student submissions for testing the grading (as provided by our moodle assignment plugin)

The "ManualTests" folder illustrates how to create manually a notebook that includes tests that are defined in an external test file.
